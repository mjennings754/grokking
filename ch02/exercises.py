2.1 Suppose you’re building an app to keep track of your finances.
Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the
end of the month, you review your expenses and sum up how much
you spent. So you have lots of inserts and a few reads. Should you
use an array or a list?
"""
"""
Answer: Linked list
"""

"""
2.2 Suppose you’re building an app for restaurants to take customer
orders. Your app needs to store a list of orders. Servers keep adding
orders to this list, and chefs take orders off the list and make them.
It’s an order queue: servers add orders to the back of the queue, and
the chef takes the first order off the queue and cooks it.
Would you use an array or a linked list to implement this queue?
(Hint: Linked lists are good for inserts/deletes, and arrays are good
for random access. Which one are you going to be doing here?)
"""

Answer: Linked list

"""
2.3 Let’s run a thought experiment. Suppose Facebook keeps a list of
usernames. When someone tries to log in to Facebook, a search is
done for their username. If their name is in the list of usernames,
they can log in. People log in to Facebook pretty often, so there are
a lot of searches through this list of usernames. Suppose Facebook
uses binary search to search the list. Binary search needs random
access—you need to be able to get to the middle of the list of
usernames instantly. Knowing this, would you implement the list as
an array or a linked list?
"""
"""
Answer: Sorted array
"""

"""
2.4 People sign up for Facebook pretty often, too. Suppose you decided
to use an array to store the list of users. What are the downsides
of an array for inserts? In particular, suppose you’re using binary
search to search for logins. What happens when you add new users
to an array?
"""
"""
Answer: Inserting into arrays is slow. If you use BS, the array needs to be sored.
